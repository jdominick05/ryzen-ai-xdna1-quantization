r"""Sample AMD RAPL package and per-core power while a workload runs.

This is the first thing in this repo that measures a watt. It exists because the NPU
exposes no power telemetry of its own -- `xrt-smi` reports `Estimated Power: N/A` and the
electrical query fails at the driver escape -- so the only way to ask "does the NPU
actually save energy" is to watch the package it shares with the CPU.

WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
Windows exposes AMD's RAPL counters through PDH, with no driver, no elevation and no
hardware context:

    \Energy Meter(RAPL_Package0_PKG)\Power        package
    \Energy Meter(RAPL_Package0_CoreN_CORE)\Power per core, N = 0..7
    \Energy Meter(_Total)\Power                   reads 0 on this machine, ignored

`Power` is in MILLIWATTS. That is MEASURED here, not read off a spec: a one-thread busy
loop steps the package +9.59 W over a 41.3 W idle, and sixteen threads step it +42.1 W to
83.5 W, which is where a 65 W-class Zen 4 desktop part belongs. The same counter set also
exposes `Energy` and `Time`; `Time` is ~1007 units/s (milliseconds), while `Energy`'s
absolute scale does NOT resolve to picojoules, microjoules or millijoules against the
Power reading. Energy tracks Power faithfully -- their ratio is constant at 0.0036 across
a 2x power range -- but its unit is UNRESOLVED, so this tool integrates the Power column
and does not use Energy.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, AND IT MATTERS
The NPU is on the same package as the CPU, so `RAPL_Package0_PKG` includes it while the
per-core meters do not. There is no NPU power domain. Any NPU figure is therefore a
RESIDUAL -- package minus the sum of cores minus whatever idle draws -- and it is only
meaningful against an idle baseline AND a matched CPU-only control run in the same
sitting. Never quote a bare wattage from this tool; quote a delta against a stated
baseline. That is docs/SILICON.md objective S4's method and it is not optional.

    python tools/power_probe.py --label idle --duration 30
    python tools/power_probe.py --label cpu-gemm --duration 30 --command "python bench.py"

Sampling shells out to Windows' built-in `typeperf` (1 s minimum interval), the same way
this repo already shells out to `xrt-smi`.
